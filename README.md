### Car Insurance APP
This Project is an MVC Web Application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes in user input and calculates
a monthly quote based on business logic. It has the basic CRUD functionality and I used Entity Framework to map users to my SQL Database. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all Customers in the dB. I also used Razor syntax inside the html docs, which I really enjoyed being able to integrate C#.

### Poker Game
This project was a console App that allowed the user to play a game of Black Jack(21). It invovled several classes
and different DataTypes, and also mapped Exceptions into a database! This one was stressful but I learned a lot.
